<p>Hi! I'm Brody. I love developing software, messing with AI, and following the financial markets.</p>

<p>I am a junior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
  I have previous internship experience at a quantitative hedge fund in Florida called Voloridge Investment Management.
  While at Voloridge, I developed a price model to simulate the costs of different hedging instrument. My results ultimately
  saved the firm a total of four million dollars a year.</p>

<p>Currently, I am interning at Oceanit Labratories, a science and engineering research firm located in Honolulu, as an AI Research Intern.
  Specifically, I focus on a subset of AI called Computer Vision. At Oceanit, my responsibilities include developing Python scripts for
  Computer Vision tasks and training SSD & RCNN models.</p>

<p class="mb-5"> This summer, I am headed to New York to intern at Deutsche Bank's Fixed Incoming Sales, Trading, & Structuring unit.</p>
