<p>Hi! I'm Brody. I love developing software, messing with AI, and following the financial markets.</p>

<p>Currently, I am a junior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa studying Computer Science and Mathematics.
  I have previous internship experience at a quantitative hedge fund in Florida called Voloridge Investment Management.
  While at Voloridge, I developed a price model to simulate different hedging instrument costs. My results ultimatley
  saved the firm a total of four million dollars a year.</p>
