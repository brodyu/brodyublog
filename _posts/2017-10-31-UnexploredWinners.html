<p>As the United States and most of Western Europe battle the COVID-19 crisis, normal life for most people has come to a halt. Many states in America are going into lockdown and forcing
  millions of Americans to shelter in place. This Black Swan event has prompted many investors to speculate on almost all facets of industries affected by the crisis. Today, I will discuss
  the industries that are often overlooked from most investors but still have room for speculation.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Google Trends</h2>

<p>To analize trends, we will use Google Trends, a free platform developed by Google to analyze the popularity of search queries and topics utilizing Google Search. Google
  Trends will allow us to quickly see what is trending and where we want to possibly investment. The best part about Google Trends is that I can quickly add the
  scripts to any HTML page, like this one, for you to view.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Working From Home</h2>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused millions of workers across America to start working from home. While most will probably return back to work in a
  few months, we will definitely see a new generation of at home workers. The pandemic has forced many businesses to adapt and now employers are
  starting to see the feasibility of remote work.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious winners from the work at home trend is computer hardware companies, like AAPL and MSFT. Google search queries for the keywords 'laptop' and 'macbook'
  have shot up dramatically. What is more surprising is that current search traffic exceeds the amount seen on Christmas and Black Friday.</p>
