<p>Trying to create a website is complicated. As if developing the front and backend wasn't
  arduous enough, one has to worry about security and network issues as well which discourages
  many from pursuing their own website. In this tutorial, I am going to provide you with an
  alternative for simple static webpages that is completely free.</p>

<p>For this tutorial we are going to be using Jekyll, a free and open source static site generator
  that runs on the Ruby programming language. What makes Jekyll great is that instead of databases,
  Jekyll renders Markdown templates, which makes writing HTML a whole lot easier. Moreover,
  Jekyll works well in combination with front-end frameworks such as Semantic UI and Bootstrap.
  For deployment of our Jekyll webpage, we are going to use GitHub Pages to host our websites for
  free.</p>

<p>There are two ways to create webpages using Jekyll. The first is most conventional,
  while the second is much easier and faster. I will be going over both in this tutorial.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Installation</h2>

<p>First, head over to the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll documentation
  page</a> and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Site</h2>

<p>Open up your terminal and type:</p>
<code>jekyll new name_of_site</code>
<p>Where name_of_site is the name of the website you want to create.<p>

<p>You should see a new repository appear that Jekyll automatically created with its base
  template. Now move into the repository and type:</p>
<code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>
<p>Bundle exec needs to be included in this command the first time you run your website.
  After, you only need to type jekyll serve. This command starts a local host website on port
  4000. Now you should be able to view your website locally by going into your preferred web
  browser and type: localhost:4000</p>

<p>Congratulations! You just created your first website. From here you can write your own blog posts,
  change to a different theme, change the layout, etc. I will include a more in-depth tutorial at the
  end for messing around with all these different options.</p>

<p>When I created my first site utilizing this method, I was quickly bothered by the mundane default
  theme, minima. However, while trying to convert my existing website into another theme, I ran
  into a lot of problems.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Easy Way</h2>

<p>A much more simplified way of doing all this and troubleshooting future theme problems is to just
  fork the theme you want from GitHub. For this website, I forked BlackrockDigitalâ€™s
  <a href="https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll</a>.
  After you fork the repository you want, delete the gh-pages branch.</p>

<p>Next, create a new branch called gh-pages and update the default branch from master to
  gh-pages. We must delete their gh-pages branch because they have a custom domain name
  that will not work for us.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/jekyll_tutorial/updateDefault.jpg">

<p>Now we can go to our GitHub pages site in Settings to view our hosted gh-page.</p>

<p>If you receive a problem building your site due to the use to relative_permalinks,
  all you have to do is delete the line: relative_permalinks: true from the config.yml file.</p>

<p>Finally, you are basically done. From here, you can edit the config.yml file to edit the main
  information of your webpage, or you can add your own blog posts in the _posts folder. I
  suggest heading over to
